  Schools do not need to do anything specific to help promote self-esteem. Self-esteem is not what schools should be focusing on - at least not solely focusing on. As mentioned on page 56 of the textbook, students can easily distinguish between meaningful praise and empty compliments. Due to this, complimenting students during school can have the opposite effect on self-esteem than desired, lowering it.

    A notable aspect to the Counterpoint section is the idea of promoting students self-concepts as part of a "beyond either/or" appeal (56).  According to the textbook, self-concept is focused on an "individuals knowledge and belies about themselves - ideas, feelings, attitudes, and expectations" (52), while self-esteem is defined as "the value each of us places on our own characteristics, abilities, and behaviours" (55). Having a strong self-concept - feeling confident about your core self - would eventually lead to having higher self-esteem. Therefore, it is more beneficial to focus on bettering students self-concepts first, rather than simply their self-esteem. If a student is given the opportunity to explore who they believe they are - develop their self-concept -their post-secondary anxieties could potentially be reduced, as students would not be as shell-shocked when coming into adulthood.

    In addition, another aspect that leads to self-esteem is one's behavioural self-control. Taking evidence from page 54 of the text, it mentions that as students mature, they're more realistic of themselves, with some even under estimating their own competence.  Self-control is defined as when an individual has the ability to manage behaviours, impulses and emotions in order to reach their ultimate goal. An ideal self control would lead children to be more likely to succeed in all aspects in life (abilities, personal, relationships with others, etc). Thus, teachers need to focus on establishing this foundation stone early in order to reach optimal self-esteem for every unique student's future. As teachers become roles of guidance, they will need to create a safe, comfortable and unbiased learning environment for their students to encourage growth of behavioural self-control (134).

    We should also consider that there are different forms of praising students. When students are emptily praised for their achievements, this causes them to develop a fixed mindset. With a fixed mindset, students are under the belief that their abilities and talents are fixed traits, in other words, that they have a certain amount of skill and they cannot change or improve upon them.This is supported by many studies and formulated by Carol Dweck, Stanford professor of psychology. What is suggested instead is to praise the process, the effort, and appreciate the behind the scenes work. When process is praised instead of product, it cultivates a growth mindset in students. The idea that they are able to improve the skill set and abilities they currently hold, makes it more likely for students to challenge themselves and  try to improve their skills.

  Teachers should take on a passive, guiding role, not actively trying to improve self-esteem
